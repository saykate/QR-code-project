### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I was able to mostly get the project to look like the original, however it has highlighted for me how much I still need to learn. I feel certain there are better ways to style the page, but I was still able to get the result using very basic CSS.

### Continued development

I will work on many more projects and search for better ways to style it in hopes of learning more ways to reach the final outcome.

## Acknowledgments

I followed along with Novidicus Titan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKsVSgSc4Ng&t=920s to get started and to learn how to use the programs and then I worked on the coding part myself, trying to recall what I have learned from FreeCodeCamp.
